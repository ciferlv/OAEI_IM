            <ontology:abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The European Union&apos;s (EU) internal market, also known as the EU Single Market, is a single market that seeks to guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people – the &quot;four freedoms&quot; – between the EU&apos;s 28 member states.The internal market is intended to be conducive to increased competition, increased specialisation, larger economies of scale, allowing goods and factors of production to move to the area where they are most valued, thus improving the efficiency of the allocation of resources.It is also intended to drive economic integration whereby the once separate economies of the member states become integrated within a single EU wide economy. Half of the trade in goods within the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.The creation of the internal market as a seamless, single market is an ongoing process, with the integration of the service industry still containing gaps. It also has an increasing international element, with the market represented as one in international trade negotiations.The internal market has been extended to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the agreement on the European Economic Area and to Switzerland through bilateral treaties. The EEA agreement and the EU-Swiss treaties have exceptions, most notably on agriculture and fisheries. These four member states of the European Free Trade Association must accept all rules related to the internal market without being able to vote on them.</ontology:abstract>
